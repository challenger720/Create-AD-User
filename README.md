This PowerShell script will create Active Directory users by importing a CSV file with:
- FirstName
- Initial
- LastName
- Title
- Temporary Password
- EmployeeID
- Department
- Division
- Manager
- Special-ID

This will also generate Display Name, Username and User Principal Name (UPN)

The template user serves as a reference what AD membership groups these newly created users should be added into.
